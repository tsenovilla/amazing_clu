Amazing_clu is a cross-platform command line utility package aiming to implement some of the most traditional comand line utilities used in Unix systems, such as grep, find,...

# Implemented utilities

## Grep

With grep, you can search for a regular expression contained in a specified file path. By default, grep ignores hidden files and directories (whose names start with .), but you can tell grep to also look into them by adding the command flag -H. To check out all the possibilities offered by this implementation try amazing_clu grep --help

## Find
This feature will be enabled soon...


# Future utilities

I aim to add echo, ls and concat in the following days

# Usage

At this time, to use this tool you have to download it and build it using Cargo, but I'll be adding a proper installer soon
